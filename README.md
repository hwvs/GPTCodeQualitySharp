# GPTCodeQualitySharp
GPTCodeQualitySharp is a code quality assessment tool that leverages OpenAI or compatible text-completion models to analyze and score source code based on multiple conventions. It uses multiple pass-throughs to accurately identify areas with poor code quality. The project includes a demo application and is a work-in-progress.
